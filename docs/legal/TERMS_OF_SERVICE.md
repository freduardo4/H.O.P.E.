# Terms of Service

Welcome to the H.O.P.E. Ecosystem ("Platform"). By using our Platform, you agree to these terms.

### 1. Marketplace Disclaimer
HOPE provides a marketplace platform connecting "Tuners" (content providers) and "End Users." HOPE does not verify the mechanical safety or emissions compliance of individual calibration files provided by Third-Party Tuners.

### 2. Emissions & Compliance
Modifying a vehicle's emissions control system is illegal in many jurisdictions for vehicles used on public roads. calibrations purchased or exchanged on this Platform are intended for **OFF-ROAD / TRACK USE ONLY**.

### 3. Financial Terms
All marketplace transactions are final. Given the digital nature of tuning files, no refunds will be issued once a file has been downloaded or flashed to hardware.

### 4. Content Ownership
Tuners retain ownership of their proprietary calibrations but grant HOPE a license to facilitate the cryptographic signing and delivery of these files to authorized users.

### 5. Indemnification
You agree to indemnify and hold harmless HOPE and its developers from any claims, damages, or liabilities arising from your use of the Platform or any vehicle modifications made using files obtained through the Platform.
