# Wiki-Fix Community Platform

Wiki-Fix is the H.O.P.E. community's knowledge base for collaborative repair and tuning patterns.

## 1. Collaborative Intelligence
Instead of searching through fragmented forums, Wiki-Fix provides structured repair patterns linked directly to OBD2 DTCs.

## 2. Knowledge Graph (Neo4j)
The backend uses a Neo4j graph to link:
- **Fault Codes**: e.g., `P0171` (System Too Lean).
- **Likely Causes**: e.g., "Vacuum Leak", "MAF Sensor", "Fuel Pump".
- **Verified Fixes**: Solutions upvoted by certified technicians.

## 3. "Lead Mechanic" Mode
The AI Assistant ("Lead Mechanic") parses Wiki-Fix data to generate plain-English explanations for complex issues, providing technicians with high-confidence starting points.

## 4. Contributing
Users can submit new fix patterns via the **HOPE Central** portal. Submissions are peer-reviewed and signed to ensure high signal-to-noise ratio.
